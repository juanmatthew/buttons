            <h1>Hi! I'm just trying to see what types of pages I can create.</h1>

            <!-- HTML for buttons !-->
            
            <nav>
                <a href="aboutme.html">
                    <button class="button-48" role="button"><span class="text">MY LITTLE SOAPBOX!!!!</span></button>
                </a>
                <a href="buttonpage.html">
                    <button class="button-48" role="button"><span class="text">Buttons!!!!</span></button>
                </a>
                <a href="logopage.html">
                    <button class="button-48" role="button"><span class="text">Logos!!!!</span></button>
                </a>
            </nav>

            <h2>YAY ME!</h2>

            <div>
                <p>I've been using Keynote to create logos & small icon designs (I refer to them as buttons here) and I had a thought to maybe try to make them into actual clickable buttons or create brand new buttons with code.</p>

                <br>

            </div>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section>
            <h3>Some of the things I want to create and add to this page are:</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <ul>
                    <a href="buttonpage.html"><li><b>Buttons</b></li></a>
                    <a href="logopage.html"><li><b>logos</b></li></a>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <br>
        
        <p>This is just a small project to see what I can remember as well as see first hand what things look like with "real" data. <br><br>I will be testing out links, designs, and colors while learning how to place things and how to overcome some of the challenges of me having one idea and the code having another.</p>

        <p>The likelyhood of me creating clickable buttons or even hitting the mark with any of my goals with this project is slim but at least the heart is there right? Plus I'll be proud of what I've accomplished regardless cause <strong><em>I DID IT!!</em></strong> I did add some logos and buttons I've created on my own to these pages and at bare minimum, they can be used as icons for pages.</p>
