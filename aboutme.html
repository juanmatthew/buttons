        <h3>But In All Seriousness...</h3>

        <p>This project is made to look a mess. My goal is to look back at this project and measure how much I've grown, how much I've learned, and if my aesthetics are still the same. </p>

        <p>I know that none of this is aesthetically pleasing however I do have some ideas as to how I feel I want to create or convey things on a site. So hopefully in a year or so I can look at these pages and be proud of the first steps I've taken (and cringe a little......ok maybe cringe alot).</p>

        <p>Essentially after a few changes and updates here and there I won't be messing with these pages anymore. I want to keep things as original and base level as possible.</p>
